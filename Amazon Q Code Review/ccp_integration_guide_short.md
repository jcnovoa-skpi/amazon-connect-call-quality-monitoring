# Amazon Connect CCP Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate the Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) with the Call Quality Monitoring solution. The integration allows you to monitor call quality metrics in real-time and store them for analysis.

## Fixed Issues

The latest update fixes the issue where metrics continued to be sent after a call ended. The fix includes:

1. **Contact State Tracking**: Added multiple checks to verify when a contact has ended
2. **Contact Ended Flag**: Added a flag that gets set when a call ends to ensure monitoring stops
3. **Agent State Monitoring**: Added detection for AfterCallWork state to stop monitoring
4. **Active Contact Verification**: Added a function to verify if a contact is still active

## Integration Steps

1. Access the CCP integration at: `https://d3tambatyz270p.cloudfront.net/ccp.html`
2. Add the CloudFront domain to your Amazon Connect approved origins
3. Toggle Demo Mode ON or OFF based on your needs
4. Make or receive calls to see real-time metrics

## Demo Mode vs. Real Mode

- **Demo Mode ON**: Generates simulated metrics even when no call is active
- **Demo Mode OFF**: Only shows metrics during actual calls, and properly stops when calls end

## Testing

1. Toggle Demo Mode OFF
2. Make a test call
3. Verify metrics are displayed during the call
4. End the call
5. Verify metrics stop being sent (check debug logs)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the debug panel for error messages
- Use the "Test API Connection" button to verify connectivity
- Clear the debug log to make it easier to track new events
- Refresh the page if needed

The integration now properly handles the call lifecycle and stops sending metrics when calls end.
