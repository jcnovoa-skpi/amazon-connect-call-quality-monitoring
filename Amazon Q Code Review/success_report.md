2. **Deploy with OpenSearch**:
   - If needed, deploy the full solution with OpenSearch:
     ```bash
     cd /System/Volumes/Data/Development/AWS/amazon-connect-call-quality-monitoring/monitoring-stack-cdk
     MONITORING_STACK_NAME="AmazonConnectMonitoringStackWithES" CCP_URL="https://demo-successkpi.my.connect.aws/ccp-v2/" cdk deploy --require-approval never
     ```

3. **Configure Amazon Connect**:
   - Set up Amazon Connect to use the deployed solution
   - Configure metrics collection
