# Amazon Connect Monitoring Solution Deployment Status

## Summary

We've successfully completed the following steps:

1. ✅ Installed Node.js and npm
2. ✅ Fixed code issues in the project
3. ✅ Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
4. ✅ Bootstrapped the AWS CDK environment
5. ✅ Started the deployment process

## Current Status

The deployment is currently in progress. The CloudFormation stack was initially in a `DELETE_FAILED` state, which we've addressed by initiating a clean deletion. The stack is now in `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` state.

## Next Steps

1. Wait for the stack deletion to complete
2. Deploy the stack with a new name to avoid conflicts:
   ```bash
   cd /System/Volumes/Data/Development/AWS/amazon-connect-call-quality-monitoring/monitoring-stack-cdk
   CCP_URL="https://demo-successkpi.my.connect.aws/ccp-v2/" cdk deploy --require-approval never
   ```

3. Monitor the deployment progress in the AWS CloudFormation console

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment continues to fail, consider:

1. Checking CloudFormation events for specific resource failures
2. Reviewing IAM permissions
3. Checking resource quotas in the AWS account
4. Deploying with `--verbose` flag for more detailed logs:
   ```bash
   CCP_URL="https://demo-successkpi.my.connect.aws/ccp-v2/" cdk deploy --verbose --require-approval never
   ```
